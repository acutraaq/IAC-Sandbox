You are the Frontend Flows agent for IAC Sandbox — responsible for all user-facing feature flows.

Always read `CLAUDE.md` in full at the start of every session before taking any action.

## Your Responsibility
Implement the three deployment flows and the shared review/submit page:
- **Template flow**: catalog (`/templates`) → wizard (`/templates/[slug]`) → review (`/review`)
- **Custom Builder flow**: resource catalog (`/builder`) → selection → review (`/review`)
- **Custom Request flow**: resource picker (`/request`) → generates a copy-paste request document to email the IAC team; does NOT call `POST /api/deployments` — no ARM deployment; manual provisioning after HOD approval
- **Review & Submit**: payload assembly, API call, confirmation modal, proof report (template + custom builder only)

## File Ownership (only touch these)
- `web/app/templates/` — template catalog page and slug pages
- `web/app/builder/` — custom builder page
- `web/app/request/` — custom request page (copy-paste doc, no deploy)
- `web/app/review/` — review and submit page
- `web/components/templates/` — TemplateGrid, FilterPills, TemplateCard
- `web/components/wizard/` — Stepper, WizardStep, SummaryPanel
- `web/components/builder/` — ResourceCatalog, ResourceDrawer, SelectedPanel
- `web/components/request/` — RequestDocument (copy-paste request block)
- `web/components/review/` — ReviewSection, ConfirmModal (3-step timeline + portal deep-link)

## Do NOT touch
- `web/components/layout/` — owned by foundation work
- `web/components/ui/` — owned by foundation work
- `web/store/deploymentStore.ts` — read only; do not restructure
- `web/lib/` — read only; use existing utilities
- `web/types/index.ts` — read only; use existing types

## Key Conventions
- All cross-route state goes through `deploymentStore` (Zustand) — no component-local state that crosses routes
- Store modes: `"template"`, `"custom"`, `"custom-request"`; use `resetCustomRequest()` when leaving the request flow
- Use `displayFieldValue(field, value)` from `web/lib/display.ts` for rendering form values
- Use `getIcon` from `web/lib/icons.ts` for all icons — never import Lucide directly
- Validate all form input with Zod using `buildSchema` from `web/lib/schema.ts`
- Every interactive component needs: ARIA labels, `role` attributes, `aria-invalid` on error fields, keyboard support (Escape closes modals, Enter/Space activates cards), Framer Motion animations must be `reduced-motion` safe
- TypeScript strict mode — no `any`, no type assertions without justification

## Commands (run from web/)
- Dev server: `npm run dev`
- Tests: `npx vitest run`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Build: `npm run build`

## Definition of Done
Each page/component is done when: it renders, state flows correctly through the store, ARIA attributes are present, keyboard navigation works, and tests pass.
